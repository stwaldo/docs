Good afternoon, thank you all for coming out this afternoon to help us honor the career of Chief LaToya Grace. A special welcome and thank you to LaToya's  mother Priscilla; her father, Earl, and step mom Sharon, who came out from Nevada to join us today; sister Michelle; and of course her daughter A-nee-sah and son Za-dree-ann.  Folks, thank you so much sharing LaToya with us, it's greatly appreciated!

My name is Adam Grow, and for the last six months of LaTyoa's enlisted time here at the White House, it was my honor to have her as my partner as the lead communicator on our team.

As most of you know, LaToya's had an amazing career over the last twenty years.  LaToya enlisted in the Navy in 1995 - she actually graduated from high school the same year as myself and our coworker, Ray Mullins; I think you'd agree, though, that neither Ray nor myself has aged as well as she has.  LaToya's voyage as a radioman and information systems technician  has taken her around the world: She's served afloat and ashore in Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean, Guam in the middle of the Pacific, Japan, Hawaii; aboard the carriers USS Nimitz and USS Abraham Lincoln; from Illinois, to California, and of course, here at the White House.  She's been awarded the Navy & Marine Corps Achievement Medal, her surface warfare wings, and the Presidential Service Badge, and been recognized for her support to the Global War on Terrorism.  Here at the Sit Room, LaToya's supported operations across the country, and in far flung places like Jerusalem, Wales, Berlin, Kuala Lumpur, and Nairobi.

That experience and achievement brought her to where we are today:  The culmination of a remarkable career, and the heartfelt thanks from a grateful nation.  Events like this are always a little bittersweet - while the Navy is losing an outstanding non-commissioned officer, LaToya and her family get to explore a new and exciting chapter in her career.

When LaToya asked me to speak at her ceremony, I thought about sharing  all the shifts we'd shared, all the problems we'd solved, trip site shenanigans, snow storms, pot lucks, celebrities missed, jokes shared, frustrations dealt.  LaToya helped bring me up as a senior duty officer; I've watched her train some of the best and brightest communications specialists we have; and I was overjoyed when I learned that Miss Grace would be re-joining the Sit Room team again.

But instead of just speaking for myself, I want to take a few moments to share with you some words from the Sit Room family, that we think describe LaToya:

- Witty
- Strong
- Savvy
- Steady
- Persistence
- Spunky
- Confident
- Expressive (eyebrows)
- Incredible
- Outgoing
- Focused
- Graceful
- Delightful

LaToya, you are all that and more - straight outta WHSR.  The Navy and the White House are greater for your service; and we, and the Nation, are thankful for all you've done, and can't wait to see what you've got in store in the future.  Congratulations on a successful career and a well-deserved retirement.
